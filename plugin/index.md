# SpesML Plugin - Overview
As a result of the project we have developed a *SpesML Plugin* for the tool *MagicDraw* [(Link)](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/no-magic/magicdraw/). In order to use the *SpesML Plugin* at least a *MagcDraw Standard Edition* as well as the *SysML Plugin* is required. The SpesML Plugin was built for MagicDraw 2021x Refresh 1.  

## Download
You can find the latest version of the SpesML Plugin [here](https://spesmlgroup.pages.rwth-aachen.de/spesml/plugin/).

## Installation
To install the *SpesML Plugin* perform the following steps:
* Start *MagicDraw*
* Ensure that you have the *SysML Plugin* installed		
* Open *Help &#x2192; Resource/Plugin Manager*	
* Click on *Import* and select the *SpesML.zip* file	
* Restart *MagicDraw*

## SpesML Model Template
The SpesML Model Template supports the automatic application of the Spes structure when a new model is created. 
To create a new model using the <i>SpesML Plugin</i> perform the following steps:
* Start *MagicDraw*
* Ensure that you have both the *SysML Plugin* and the *SpesML Plugin* installed
* Open *File &#x2192; New Project...*
* Open the *Systems Engineering* section
* Specify the *Name* and *Project location*
* Select *OK*

## SpesML Perspectives
The *SpesML Plugin* provides two perspectives:
1. The *SpesML (Novice)* perspective reduces all toolbars and context menus to the minimum set of required options. This is recommended for new users.
2. The *SpesML (Expert)* perspective adds more sophifisticated options to toolbars and context menus.  
  
Of course you can use the defaults MagicDraw perspectives e.g. *Full Featured* to work with the *SpesML Plugin*.

## Integrated Help
The *SpesML Plugin* provides a fully integrated help. There are two ways to access the SpesML Help:
1. Open *Help &#x2192; SpesML Documentation* to access this help page directly from within MagicDraw
2. Open the *Specification* of any SpesML model element or SpesML diagram and click on *Help* to access an element/diagram specific help page
